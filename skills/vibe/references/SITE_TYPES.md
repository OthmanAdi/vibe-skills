# Site Type Archetypes

Match the user's request to the closest archetype. Use the structure and content strategy as a starting point, then customize for the specific context.

## Portfolio / Personal Site

**Purpose:** Showcase work, skills, and personality.

**Sections:**
- Hero with name, role, and one defining statement (not a paragraph)
- Selected work (3-6 projects with thumbnails or descriptions)
- Brief about section with a photo or illustration
- Contact: email link, social links, or simple form
- Optional: blog/writing section, timeline/experience

**Design guidance:**
- Let the work speak — minimal chrome, maximum content
- Personal sites should feel personal — inject personality into the copy
- Avoid the "developer portfolio template" look (dark bg, neon green, terminal font)
- Consider: editorial layout, magazine-style grid, or single-scroll narrative

**Content density:** Medium. Quality over quantity.

## Landing Page / Product

**Purpose:** Explain a product and drive a single action (signup, download, purchase).

**Sections:**
- Hero with value proposition (one sentence), subheading, and CTA button
- Social proof (logos, numbers, or a single powerful testimonial)
- How it works (3-5 steps, not features)
- One feature deep-dive with visual
- Pricing or CTA repeat
- Footer with links

**Design guidance:**
- One CTA action per page — every section builds toward it
- Above the fold: value prop must be readable in 3 seconds
- Social proof works better as logos or numbers than as paragraph testimonials
- Pricing: if shown, make the recommended plan visually dominant

**Content density:** Low-medium. Breathing room. Every word earns its place.

## Restaurant / Food Service

**Purpose:** Menu, hours, location, and reservation.

**Sections:**
- Hero with ambiance photo or food photography, name, tagline
- Menu highlights (not the full menu — 6-12 signature items)
- Hours and location with embedded map or address
- Reservation CTA or phone number
- Gallery (4-8 photos in a grid or carousel)
- Footer with address, phone, social

**Design guidance:**
- Photography-driven — food and ambiance carry the design
- Warm palettes: earth tones, cream backgrounds, rich accents
- Typography: pair a serif display with a clean sans body
- Avoid: flashy animations, dark techy aesthetics

**Content density:** Medium. Visual-heavy.

## Event / Conference

**Purpose:** Date, location, speakers, registration.

**Sections:**
- Hero with event name, date, location, and register CTA
- Speakers/performers (grid with photos, names, titles)
- Schedule (timeline or table format)
- Venue info with map or directions
- Sponsors/partners (logo row)
- Registration CTA repeat

**Design guidance:**
- Date and location must be instantly visible
- Create urgency without being pushy
- Speaker photos should be consistent (same crop, same treatment)
- Consider: bold typography, high contrast, event-specific color theme

**Content density:** High. Lots of structured data.

## Business / Professional Service

**Purpose:** Establish credibility and generate inquiries.

**Sections:**
- Hero with what you do and for whom
- Services (3-5 core offerings, not a laundry list)
- Results or case studies (numbers, outcomes)
- Team or about section
- Contact form or booking link
- Footer with credentials, certifications, address

**Design guidance:**
- Trust signals matter: real numbers, real names, real outcomes
- Conservative palette with one confident accent color
- Typography: clean, readable, professional (serif or refined sans)
- Avoid: stock photos of handshakes, "synergy" language, corporate buzzwords

**Content density:** Medium. Substance over flash.

## Blog / Writing / Publication

**Purpose:** Read articles. Subscribe.

**Sections:**
- Header with publication name and navigation
- Featured article (large)
- Article grid or list (6-12 recent posts)
- Category/tag navigation
- Newsletter signup
- Footer with archives, about, social

**Design guidance:**
- Typography IS the design — invest in the reading experience
- Maximum line length: 65ch for body text
- Generous line-height (1.6-1.8 for long-form)
- Minimal distraction: no sidebars on article pages
- Consider: serif body font for long-form readability

**Content density:** High. Text-heavy by nature.

**Purpose:** Show what the product looks like when in use.

**Sections:**
- Sidebar navigation (collapsible)
- Top bar with user info and search
- Main content area with cards, charts, or tables
- Optional: notification panel, activity feed

**Design guidance:**
- Use the compact typography scale
- Dense but organized — align to 8px grid strictly
- Neutral base palette with primary accent for actions
- Data visualization: simple bar/line charts with CSS or inline SVG
- `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums` on all numbers

**Content density:** High. Information-dense by design.

**Purpose:** Capture emails before launch.

**Sections:**
- Full-screen hero with product name and one-line description
- Email capture form (one field + submit)
- Optional: countdown, feature tease, social links

**Design guidance:**

**Content density:** High. Reference-dense.
